#  AAPL Stock Price Predictor

This project is a basic stock price prediction tool using *Linear Regression. It fetches historical stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)* and predicts stock prices using Python. The model is trained on past closing prices and visualizes actual vs. predicted results for easy comparison.


##  Features

* Downloads real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
* Uses Linear Regression to forecast stock price trends
* Visualizes actual vs predicted prices in a graph
* Easy to understand and modify for learning purposes


##  Technologies Used

* Python
* yfinance
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib


##  Project Files

* predict_stock.py – Main script that performs the prediction
* README.md – This documentation file


##  How to Use

1. Make sure *Python* is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

   * yfinance
   * pandas
   * numpy
   * matplotlib
   * scikit-learn
3. Open the predict_stock.py file in VS Code or any Python editor.
4. Run the script.
5. A graph will be displayed comparing *actual* and *predicted* stock prices.


##  Output

After running the script, you'll see a line graph with:

* *Actual stock prices* over time
* *Predicted prices* based on the regression model

This gives a clear visual idea of how the model performs.


##  Customization Tips

* To analyze a different stock, replace 'AAPL' in the code with any valid stock symbol (e.g., 'MSFT', 'TSLA').
* You can also change the start and end date to fetch a different time period.
